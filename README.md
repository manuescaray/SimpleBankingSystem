# SimpleBankingSystem

This project is about a simple banking system with the following menu: 1. Create an account, 2. Log In, 3. Exit. The program basically creates an account through the generation of a card number and a PIN. The card number is validated with the Luhn algorithm. All the accounts are then saved within the database created with SQLite library included in Python 3.x. When the user loggs-in, he can check the balance, add incomes, do transfers and even close the account.
